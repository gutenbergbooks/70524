<p class="hang">SCENE.—<i>A little low white cottage, approached by a
gravel-path which winds up from gray, moss-grown steps at</i>
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, <i>flanked by lilac-bushes. A sunken step leads
across the tiny pillared porch, twined deep with honeysuckle
which, together with the tall, recently-acquired French
windows, stands open into the living-room, dark now except for
its moonlit shadows.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>At the rise of the curtain there is a moment in which
the dark and stillness permeate one; then there is a slight
noise overhead, an electric light flashes in the upper hall,
and a tallish, youthfully old figure that is</i> <span class="smcap">Martin
Doan</span>, <i>wearing valet’s livery, can be made out,
descending the little flight of stairs just inside. As he
reaches the bottom, the heavy strokes of the clock in the
church tower, faintly visible in the middle-distance, begin to
boom out midnight.</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span> <i>pauses, listening. As
the strokes proceed, he steps into the open doorway, and peers
into the garden.</i></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p class="hang">[<i>Then, snapping the profound quiet which succeeds the
ending of the chimes, there is an abrupt movement above stairs,
and</i> <span class="smcap">George Sanford’s</span> <i>voice, thick but vibrant
with unwonted excitement, calls</i>.</p>

you got to keep <i>you</i> awake?</p>

<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p>[<i>Measuring a conscious distance in his voice.</i>] I hardly
know, sir! It was such a night, sir! I was going to bring up the
ear-trumpet——</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Joining</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span> <i>on the doorstep, his
too-well-fitting clothes making an open secret of his stoutness</i>.]
Well, well, did you think you’d find it here, listening to those
everlasting chimes? But I’m glad you reminded me, Martin! I shouldn’t
have slept a wink if I hadn’t known it was all right, every way!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Again turning to go in.</i>] Yes, sir, I put it on the table with

</p>

<p>Thanks. [<i>Laying a protesting hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Martin’s</span>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Sentimentally looking up at the moon.</i>] Just look at her! Isn’t
she splendid? Doesn’t she—— [<i>He breaks into a fat chuckle.</i>]
Now just listen to that, will you? Don’t that show the state I’m
in—callin’ the moon “her” and “she”! Why, that’s what they say
in the magazines. I was readin’ one last night—[<i>With fatuous
explicitness.</i>] one of those <i>love</i>-stories! Why, Martin, I
haven’t said “her” and “she” for forty years!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Dutifully.</i>] Yes, sir.</p>

<p>[<i>Testily.</i>] Well, don’t that show——?</p>

<p class="center">

<p>[<i>Dreamy eyes on the cedar over the cottage.</i>] The moon’s
beautiful, sir!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>With a pitying snort.</i>] Beautiful! Why, Martin, beautiful’s
no word for it! She—she’s elegant! Magnificent—er—“magnifique,” I
think the French would call it! Such a romantic language, French! Mrs.
McCormorant’s kept a French maid for years! But of course you couldn’t
be expected to know, or—[<i>A sentimental hand on his heart.</i>] or
feel——!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Suddenly attentive.</i>] Not a pain, sir, in your heart?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Starting irritably.</i>] Pain?—in my heart? What are you talking
about?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Beg pardon, sir, but I understood the doctor said——</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Damn the doctor! Don’t you know I only went to satisfy Evelina—Mrs.
McCormorant? Why, I never was fitter in my life! But she does love
me so—[<i>Sighing.</i>] and I her! I her! Ah, Martin, again that is
something <i>you</i> cannot understand—when two hearts beat as one!
[<i>Scornfully, as</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span> <i>says nothing</i>.] I suppose
you’d think it was a disease!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Sir——?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Holding him as both look into the garden.</i>] Ah, no matter! Just

I—here in the Bird’s Nest—— [<i>Chuckling.</i>] Ha-ha—not bad,

little sea-shell ear!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p>Yes, yes, I wanted it, but you see—I’d just been saying—er—I’d just

it, no matter! No matter!</p>

<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Shall I fetch it, sir?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Reluctantly turning indoors with him.</i>] I suppose so! But
mind, if ever I find you insinuating things about Mrs. McCormorant’s
deafness—oh, well, you may take your month’s pay and clear out! Why,
it might gum the whole game!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p>Yes, sir. In fact, sir, as you mentioned it, and a similar thought
being in my own mind——</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>

<p>[<i>Hastily.</i>] I’m not mentioning anything, Martin—and neither

<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Sanford.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The story? Oh, yes! [<i>At first he speaks into the tube, but as he
continues, he seems to forget his original purpose, becoming engrossed
in his subject.</i>] Well, I had it from the man I bought Bird’s Nest
of, a year ago, before I put in the improvements. Queer! I don’t
believe I’ve thought of it since that day! And I asked him why he
didn’t put it in order himself, and he—he said that years ago his
father was planning to bring his bride here when——</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

see the joke?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

<p>The story? Dear, no! A ghost-story, Martin—think of that! Brrr-rrr!
[<i>With a mock shiver, lowering his voice in coarse joviality.</i>]
Spooks—haunted! Nobody but me’s had the nerve to think of living
here for fifty years and more! Afraid the visitors mightn’t approve.
Visitors—ha-ha! Bear in mind, Martin—Bird’s Nest was built for
lovers. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Sanford</span> <i>begins to laugh again</i>,

safe return? [<i>With a desperate little sob.</i>] Oh, Richard, I—I

gipsy woman came to our house one day, and she read my palm—Mamma was
out—or she never would have permitted it!—And she told me——</p>

<p class="center">

<p>What did she tell you?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>

<p>[<i>With a laugh, though his eyes are troubled.</i>] Was she referring
to my Greek? That ended where it began!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Seriously, as they pass through the open door into the little
parlor.</i>] Mamma thought it meant my marriage! She consulted the
Vicar, but he was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> highly educated to believe in such “nonsense,”
he called it! And I was always so happy—in spite of sister Eliza’s
being so much prettier than me—don’t you think so, Richard?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] Eliza! Flibbertigibbets! Why, you’re the
prettiest girl in the world! [<i>Turning her to the tall mirror at the
side of the room.</i>] There! See for yourself——!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] How on earth can you think so? [<i>Then she goes
close and examines the cut for herself.</i>] Lucky my hair curls, isn’t
it? This horrid little mark will never show. Now poor sister Eliza—of

</p>

<p>[<i>Watching</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] Why, Madam, Mr. Sanford had it put
here to surprise her, her becoming his bride in the little church here
to-morrow!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>

alive!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Puzzled.</i>] But her frock? My wife was quite certain, and so was
I, that her frock was—er—well, I don’t like to say anything against
the lady, but, well, you know, rather old-fashioned, to say the least!
[<i>With an admiring glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia’s</span> <i>panniers</i>.]
You can see—there’s rather a difference——!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>With the ghost of a smile.</i>] There is, indeed, sir!
[<i>Resuming, practically.</i>] But I have often heard Mr. Sanford say,
sir, that all Mrs. McCormorant’s gowns are in the height of fashion!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Restlessly.</i>] Of course her frock is of no consequence—nor her

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>With a note of authority.</i>] Yes, that’s what we don’t care for!
Why should her portrait be here, in our parlor?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>

she comes to live here to-morrow!</p>

<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>

We—[<i>Vainly trying to repress a quiver in his voice.</i>] we must
have misunderstood him!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Softly repulsing him, sitting bolt upright.</i>] No, I don’t think

before about—about Bird’s Nest?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Jumping up and confronting</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span> <i>with the piteous

Nest?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Very low.</i>] Yes, Madam!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>

are to live in Bird’s Nest?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Very gently.</i>] Are you sure, Madam?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>She looks long into his troubled, wistful eyes; then

you know? We were to live here—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> then—then Ajax was frightened
by the steam-car, coming home from church this afternoon, and ever
since——</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Softly, as</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>stops, unable to proceed</i>.] The
folks about here always say Bird’s Nest was built for lovers!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>In a low voice.</i>] The folks? Since when have they said that? I
never heard it!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>With a long look.</i>] No, Madam,—it was not—in your day!
[<i>Then, softly to himself, looking from</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>to</i>
<span class="smcap">Richard</span>.] Built for lovers——!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>As before.</i>] And are they—lovers?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Mrs. McCormorant is very rich.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Shocked.</i>] You keep saying, “Mrs.”! She has been married before?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Just so! An attractive woman some think, sir, in spite of her deafness.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>But why should she be deaf?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>With sudden petulance.</i>] What does it matter whether she’s deaf
or not when——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Imperturbably to</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>.] It’s merely her age,
sir——! Sixty-three she is, but——</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Good God! It’s impossible! It’s unnatural!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Watching</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>narrowly</i>.] She took a great
fancy to Bird’s Nest the day Mr. Sanford brought her over! It makes
them both feel quite young again, so they say!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Under her breath.</i>] Young! Sixty-three——! I’m not eighteen——!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Watching her as before.</i>] Haven’t old people a right to
happiness, Madam?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Irrelevantly, a passionate ring in her voice.</i>] The folks about
here say Bird’s Nest was built for lovers!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] Quite so, Madam! [<i>With an old-fashioned bow.</i>]
I am glad to have seen you, Madam—I had heard—so much. But I must
go now. I have to make sure Mr. Sanford has taken his medicine before
retiring—his heart’s not just right.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>In a level voice.</i>] Mr. Sanford, I presume, is the bridegroom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Martin.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Withdrawing with grave courtesy.</i>] Er—yes, sir! And somewhat

he’s not being married to-morrow!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Starting.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Practically.</i>] Well, I prefer their being horrid—like that
man and that dreadful woman in the house! [<i>Reminiscently.</i>] I
couldn’t help being sorry for the gentle lady that was here,—oh, you
know, quite a while ago!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>You mean the one they called “Virginia”? That was visiting Bird’s Nest
before he brought her here to live?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Yes, Virginia! But he didn’t really love her! We couldn’t have had
<i>them</i> about! What a cold she took that night! [<i>Placidly.</i>]
I guess it settled on her lungs right away! [<i>With a little
smile.</i>] They weren’t here when we came back.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>A trifle uncomfortably.</i>] I know——!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>And another year—that dark beauty. He was speaking a foreign tongue
to her when we came. “Celeste,” I think her name was. I think it is a
French name. With what I had picked up at the Academy for Young Ladies,
I could easily see they were planning to settle right here in a few
weeks. She didn’t love him at all! [<i>With a mischievous laugh.</i>]
Do you remember how frightened she was, Richard? [<i>Smoothing her
little panniers.</i>] Big women are always such cowards!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>As before.</i>] Yes, of course,—but——</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>With a touch of asperity.</i>] What is it, Richard?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>You—we’ve upset the plans of a good many people, haven’t we?
Need we bother any more about them? [<i>Gently.</i>] We have each
other—to-night——!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>

<p>[<i>With infinite wistfulness.</i>] Ah, Richard! Richard! You are
only a man——! [<i>Very low.</i>] No one must live here! Don’t you
understand?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>We couldn’t come back! Just think, Richard—[<i>Caressing him

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] Just so, Richard! I know you always agree when
you—remember——!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Regarding her with sudden anxiety.</i>] Do you think you can manage
it? The lady isn’t here—this time.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>But he’s here! And do you know, Richard, in spite of what Mamma has
always taught me, I hardly think men are a bit braver than women!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Oh, Lydia, you really think not!</p>

<p class="center">

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Falling into her mood.</i>] Why not make it yourself? The spinnet
is there—[<i>Pointing within.</i>] your papa’s wedding present—he
thought you would like it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> the first night! Look, Lydia, how clear it
stands in the moonlight!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lydia.</span><br>
</p>

<p>[<i>Running into the house.</i>] I could play the minuet! [<i>Seating
herself at the spinnet, she plays a few bars of a minuet with delicate,

But, oh, that isn’t enough! [<i>Jumping up, she drags him after her to

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Richard.</span><br>

<p>There will be music, dear Richard! Don’t you remember—it used to

[<i>And presently, as if encouraged by her voice, the garden becomes
